2.  Scroll down and click "Moderation".

-   The toggle at the top turns on and off the anti-spam system, which will mute players who send too many messages too fast. Note that commands do not count as messages, but all other chat types do (sending unique messages at a fast pace will also trigger the system).

-   The "Wait Time" box contains the amount of time (in seconds) that players will be muted for after triggering the anti-spam.

-   The "Maximum Time Between Messages" box contains the amount of time (in seconds) that players need to wait between messages in order to not trigger the anti-spam.

-   The "Message Count To Trigger Anti-Spam" slider sets the number of messages that must be sent too fast in order to trigger the anti-spam.

-   You can make it so that specific players can bypass the anti-spam system by giving them the `canBypassAntiSpam` tag.
